      <h2>A Short Biography</h3>
    </main>
    <p id="bio">
      My name is Jeff Ostlund, born and raised in Olympia, WA. I lived in Bellingham for 3 years as well, </br>and now I have been living in Seattle for the last 3 years. I enjoy basketball and football, snowboarding </br>in the winter, and wakeboarding in the summer. In my free time I try to read as much as I can while mixing </br>in some movies here and there.
    </p>
    <p id="school">
      I went to high school in Olympia before moving to Bellingham for my Associate's degree. I will be </br>moving to Pullman to go to Washington State Unversity to continue my four-year degree next year.
    </p>
    <p id="work">
      Throughout my 20s I worked a lot of odd jobs: a butcher at Safeway, werehouse worker, Server/Bar-</br>tender, and finally a Relationshp Banker at Chase before starting Code Fellows. My first job was working at </br>Wendy's when I was 17.
    </p>
    <p id="goal">
      What I am really excited for is being to able to pay my way through my last two years of WSU after </br>finishing Code Fellows. I have been putting off getting my Bachelor's for a long time, and it will be a relief. </br>Beyond school and education, though, investing in real estate and stocks will be fun. After traveling absolutely </br>everywhere in the world, eventually, I would love to have a family.
