# About Me Lab

This project started as a simple 5 question yes/no quiz so the user can get to know me. I'm going to add a few more things to develop the quiz:

- top 10 movies
- adding a 6th question asking the user to guess a number while giving the user only 4 attempts
- adding a 7th question utilizing an array
- finally providing a final score for how many correct answers they got

## Lab03 to Lab04 Changes

- Edited the  last couple questions to create more efficient loops
- Worked with Chance on parseInt to compare numerical data (=== vs ==) "ask Jacob about character codes"
- Added the number guessing game
- Added a score keeper
- Added an alert at the end using the user's name and returning their score
